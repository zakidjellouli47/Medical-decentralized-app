# ⭐️ ⭐️ Decentralized medical application based on blockchain  ⭐️ ⭐️

Creating a decentralized application for a system smart hospital using Blockchain technology and to achieve this we will cover several security concepts like cryptography and IoT and smart cities, and we create a design for the medical system to implement the interface of
the application finally.

# Project output
Every user(actor) performs a registration action in the first time , then after that an authentication action is
required only to enter the hospital system so it’s an obligated action(include) , and for the action to be more
secured , it’s required to use the meta mask extension by using the public and private key to enter the critical
information of the user.

The admin is required alternatively to login to be able to enter the hospital management system which is ver-
ified by the database server, after the account is confirmed the admin can add accounts and save them in the
database and he gets a message "successful operation" after that.

The director is also required alternatively to login to be able to enter the hospital management system which
is verified by the database server, after the account is confirmed the director can request to delete transactions
so they would be deleted from t the database and he gets a message "successful operation" after that.

The doctor is also required alternatively to login to be able to enter the hospital management system which
is verified by the database server, after the account is confirmed the director can request to update a medical
record of the patient , and they will be encrypted in the blockchain server and saved in the chains and after
that , the doctor gets a message "successful operation" after that.

The patient is also required alternatively to login to be able to enter the hospital management system which
is verified by the database server, after the account is confirmed the patient can request medical supplies from
the pharmacy and after that he can consult the list of medical supplies and buy the ones he needs .
